# Preparing dependencies for your system
These dotfiles require certain programs to be installed and configured to have all of their features functional. 

## Base Dependencies
* hyprpolkitagent
* fastfetch
* nfs-utils 
* xdg-portal-hyprland 
* xdg-portal-gtk 
* xdg-portal-gnome 
* meson 
* waybar
* code

```bash 
sudo pacman -S hyprpolkitagent btop code nfs-utils xdg-portal-hyprland xdg-portal-gtk xdg-portal-gnome meson waybar
```
The xdg-portal-* and hyprpolkitagent must be started with exec-once during autostart in the hyprland.conf (This is already set up in the dotfiles)

## Audio Control and applet in pipewire
* pavucontrol
* Optional: pipewire-pulse (only if using pipewire to bridge to pavucontrol)

```bash
sudo pacman -S pavucontrol pipewire-pulse
```

## Shell Customization
* Oh-My-Posh

Install Oh-My-Posh like so:
https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/linux
```
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s
```
If there are issues, add ```~/.local/bin``` to your PATH variable (e.g. in ```/etc/environment```)


## Bluetooth
Follow instructions from https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth

Then add the Blueman applet as the gui
```bash
sudo pacman -S blueman
```

## Application Launcher
* ~~rofi~~
* vicinae

if wofi or rofi is installed from e.g. arch-install:
```bash
sudo pacman -R wofi rofi
```
then install vicinae according to https://docs.vicinae.com/install/repo#arch-linux-aur

e.g.
```
yay -S vicinae-bin
```

To make use of the dynamic theming you will have to set the theme to vicinae-hppy-dynamic

```
vicinae theme set vicinae-hppy-dynamic
```

This theme is auto generated by the script ```~/dotfiles/globalscripts/wallpaper/post_set_wallpaper.sh``` which should be automatically executed after a wallpaper is applied. See the Wallpaper / Waytrogen section for more infos.

## Notification demon
* swaync
if dunst is installed (e.g. from arch-install) remove it
```bash
sudo pacman -R dunst
```
then install swaync
```bash
sudo pacman -S swaync
```

## Calculator
* Qalculate-QT
```bash
sudo pacman -S qalculate-qt
```

## Terminal navigator
* yazi

Install yazi according to instructions: https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/installation

```bash
sudo pacman -S yazi ffmpeg 7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide resvg imagemagick
```

## fonts
woff2-font-awesome
nerd-fonts
noto-fonts-emoji
ttf-fira-sans
ttf-fira-code
ttf-material-icons-git (aur)
sudo pacman -S noto-fonts-{cjk,emoji,extra}
-> e.g. in code oss you have to set 'Symbols Nerd Font Mono' as a possible font 
-> e.g. in Vivaldi you have to set the primary font also to a nerd font

## Screenshot Utilities
* grimblast
* satty
* wl-clipboard
* hyprpicker

```bash 
yay -S grimblast-git 
sudo pacman -S satty wl-clipboard hyprpicker
```

## Theme managers
We will be installing 2 theme managers to make generating gtk and qt configs easier.
* qt6ct
* nwg-look

```bash 
sudo pacman -S qt6ct nwg-look
```

### Themes
```bash
sudo pacman -S breeze breeze-gtk
```

Now using the theme managers apply the themes if you are experiencing theming inconsistencies


# Icons! (Waybar tray)
* to get symbolic icons in blueman applet -> Right click -> Plugins -> Status Icon -> Configuration -> Force Symbolic status icons
* to get symbolic icons in most other applications: open nwg-look -> icontheme -> set a breeze icon theme

# Wallpapers and dynamic color schemes
Waytrogen (AUR) is recommended for wallpaper setting
```bash
 yay -S waytrogen
 ```

After installation; in ```.config/waytrogen/config.json``` set the ```executable script``` to the absolute path of
```~/dotfiles/globalscripts/wallpaper/post_set_wallpaper.sh```
without any "~" and without "$HOME" expansion

Wallpaper daemons that are supported:

* hyprpaper
* awww (https://codeberg.org/LGFae/awww) (AUR)
* mpvaper (https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper)

### Additionally if using mpvpaper 
Using mpv-stop (fork of mpvpaper-stop) is recommended and is set up in hypr autostart to conserve cpu power when windows are in front of your animated wallpaper
Install instructions: https://github.com/HppyDedPxl/mpvpaper-stop

# Additional nice to haves I recommend
* gnome-system-monitor
* btop 


## sddm dynamic theme setup

```
mkdir /etc/sddm.conf.d/
```
create new file in that folder "sddm.conf"
```
